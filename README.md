The user is welcomed with a Pyfiglet styled text. This text displays the Dog Walk AB logo. This gives the otherwise bland terminal a fun decor.
The Welcome text provides the user with information on how to enter number of walks. If the user enters invalid information there will be a error message. Then the user will be asked to insert new values until the values are correct.
